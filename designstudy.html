    <h2><b>1. Learning</b></h2>
    As traditional energy sources such as coal and natural gas are running out, it is important to research into and
    utilize renewable energy sources. Renewable sources can be replenished, while non-renewables are finite. 85% of the
    US's energy usage is non-renewable (U.S. Energy Information Administration).
    It is believed that oil and gas will run out by the end of the century (BP Statistical Review of World Energy,
    2020).
    <br><br>
    In our tool, we would like to focus on how states use renewable energy, trends of renewable energy usage by state
    and year, and use it to help increase adoption of renewable sources. By looking at historical data, we can identify
    states who are doing well in renewable energy adoption, and use them as models when creating next generation energy
    policies that will increase renewable energy adoption countrywide.

                                1. When choosing states as a model: we can look at Maine.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In the most recent years, Maine used renewable energy ~3 times less than
                                        non-renewable
                                        energy. It used it be ~7 times less in the 1970s</li>
                                    <li>Maine uses wood as their 2nd most used fuel source</li>
                                    <li>Recommend studying further into how Maine is able to utilize renewable energy
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Is this possible for other states? Maine has a low population (1.4 million) and
                                        90%
                                        of
                                        Maine is forested (Maine TREE Organization)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                2. Texas used 224.95 times more non-renewable energy than renewable in 2019.

                                3. To improve Texas's fuel usage, money should be divested from the petroleum industry
                                and
                                towards industries like wood and solar that offer long-term renewability.

                                    <li>Difficult, as petroleum is a large part of Texas's economy</li>

                                4. We need to account for state population and sources available in the state because
                                renewable sources are dependent on climate, geography and vegetation.
